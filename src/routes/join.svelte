			Mustang Math is a <b style="color: #1B9AAA;">nonprofit organization</b> of
			high school and college volunteers that are dedicated towards providing
			middle schoolers access to challenging, interesting, fun, and
			collaborative math competitions and resources! We are the organizers of
			the annual <b style="color: #1B9AAA;">Mustang Math Tournament</b>
			as well as our individual 3MT, run low-cost and high-quality
			<b style="color: #1B9AAA;">mathematics teaching</b>
			and are also working on many new and exciting projects such as building an online test-taking platform, 
			creating our own math curriculum and books, and expanding
			our social media reach! We reached
			<b style="color: #1B9AAA;">almost 600 U.S. competitors</b> across our 6 locations of MMT 2024
			contests, and we're expecting many more in our international tournament this
			upcoming August. We are excited to expand our team to continue our mission
			of spreading a love for mathematics amongst students.

			You should join Mustang Math if you are in high school or college and are
			passionate about promoting an interest in competition math to younger
			students!

				>competition math</b
			>
			and the
			<b style="color: #1B9AAA;">community</b> that it provides to other
			students. Additionally, as a non-profit organization on the rise, there
			are numerous opportunities for volunteers to
			<b style="color: #1B9AAA;">share ideas</b>
			and <b style="color: #1B9AAA;">suggest projects</b> that they are
			interested in. Overall, working in the Mustang Math team is both a fun and
			fulfilling experience where volunteers are able to pursue their passion
			all while learning <b style="color: #1B9AAA;">real-life skills</b> such as
			teamwork, time management, and how to see a project through to completion.

			For 2024-2025, we are looking to expand our in-person tournaments to include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Washington (Seattle)</li>
			<li>Northern California (Bay)</li>
			<li>Southern California (LA/San Diego)</li>
			<li>Illinois (Chicago)</li>
			<li>Massachusetts (Boston)</li>
			<li>Texas (Austin/Houston/Dallas)</li>
			<li>Virginia (Alexandria/DC)</li>
			<li>Georgia (Atlanta)</li>
			<li>Nevada (Las Vegas)</li>
			<li>North Carolina, (Chapel Hill/Raleigh/Charlotte)</li>
			<li>Minnesota (Minneapolis)</li>
			<li>Colorado (Denver)</li>
		</ul>
		<p style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center;">
			These locations would be responsible for running an in-person location of MMT 2025 to the students
			from their state and nearby areas, and will also receive support from
			Mustang Math to run other similar events. If you're from these areas and
			want to help give a wonderful contest experience to your local middle
			school students, highly consider joining!
