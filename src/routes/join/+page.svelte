			high school and college volunteers that are dedicated towards providing
			middle schoolers access to challenging, interesting, fun, and
			collaborative math competitions and resources! We are the organizers of
			the annual <b style="color: #1B9AAA;">Mustang Math Tournament</b>
			as well as our individual MMM, run low-cost and high-quality
			<b style="color: #1B9AAA;">mathematics teaching</b>
			and are also working on many new and exciting projects such as building an online test-taking platform, 
			creating AMC and MATHCOUNTS mocks, and expanding
			our social media reach! We reached
			<b style="color: #1B9AAA;">almost 900 U.S. competitors</b> across our 9 locations of MMT 2025
			contests, and we're expecting many more in our international tournament this
			upcoming August. We are excited to expand our team to continue our mission
			of spreading a love for mathematics amongst students.
